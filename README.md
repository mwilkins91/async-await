# async-await

### Note:
- The branch `then` contains working code using the `.then()` / `.catch()` style of handling promises
- The branch `await` contains working code using the `async/await` style of handling promises
- The brand `master` contains non-working code, with Pseudo code in place for the `getUser` method on the `App` component. Fill in the function with your own code! Try both styles!

# Areas of the codebase you will want to look at in each branch:
- `/src/components/Appjs`
- `/lib/routes/userRouter.js`
